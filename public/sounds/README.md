# Sound Effects

This directory contains sound effects for the ShujaaQuest game.

## Required Files

- `correct.mp3` - Sound played when user answers correctly
- `wrong.mp3` - Sound played when user answers incorrectly  
- `bgm.mp3` - Background music (Kenyan-themed, loopable)

## Notes

- Files should be optimized for web (small file sizes)
- Background music should be loopable and not too distracting
- Sound effects should be short and satisfying
- Consider using royalty-free music and sounds

## Fallback

If sound files are not available, the game will still work without audio.
